Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A. Software engineering is the use of concepts and methods from engineering to develop and maintain software systems. It is has quite a significant importance to the tech industry since it is by means of it we are able to create software solutions to many problems that make many aspects of day to day life more convenient.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
A. These key milestones include, establishing software engineering as a proper engineering discipline, the creation of progamming languages and the use agile methods.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
A. They are the following:
  Design: Developing advanced and detailed UI and software architecture designs.
  Implementation: Writing code and design specifications to develop software.
  Testing: Conducting tests to make sure software meets quality standards and functions as needed.
  Deployment: RDeploying software to users.
  Maintenance: Providing ongoing support and necessary improvements to software post deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
A.The agile methodology is more sequential with different phases, an example would be with large scale applications with strict regulatory requirements and with a lot more predictability. Agile is more incremental and places greater emphasis on collaboration and flexibility, an example would be in a project requires frequent customer feedback and there is a need for rapid delivery of software. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A. A  Software developer is responsible for writing code for a program or software and implementing solutions from such, a quality assurance engineer job is to ensure that the software is of high quality and they do this by designing/executing test plans, a project manager is in charge of planning, executing, and finally delivering the software project. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
A. IDEs are important because they provide advanced tools to write, test and debug your code, examples include Visual Studio Code, pycharm, x-code, etc. VCS are important for tracking changes to the source code and coordinating between programmers working together, and example would be Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A. Various changes in requirements of what is being developed, very short deadline periods and future problems resulting in shortcuts and sub-par technical solutions. To solve some of the issues effective communication, the use of agile and prioritizing tasks whilst frequently reviewing goals and timelines is necessary.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
A. Unit Testing involves Testing individual parts of the program, integration testing involves testing interactions between different parts of the program, system testing involves testing the entire program whole and acceptance testing involves running tests on the program to see how well it meets the users needs. It is important in identifying and fixing potential issues in the program early on before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
A. Prompt engineering is the ability to ask AI models clear and concise questions or prompts and give it such instructions to maximize the accuracy of it's output or answers to prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A. Vague: 'Tell me about Coding'
  Concise: "Tell me about the different languages in coding, what makes them different from each other and why, and how the communicate with a computer"
  The 2nd prompt is more effective because it is more specific and tells the AI exactly what to look for or do, and it is not too broad.
